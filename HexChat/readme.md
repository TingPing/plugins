##Notes

The majority of these scripts require HexChat 2.9.6+ as a lot was changed in that release.

Most scripts will work in Python 2.7 or 3.3+ on Windows or Linux.

Any javascript scripts will require the plugin I wrote that can be found [here](https://github.com/TingPing/hexchat-javascript).

I recommend my [script](./script.py) script. It allows simply running ```/script [install|update|remove] SCRIPTNAME.py``` to manage my scripts.

All scripts are under the [MIT license](/license).
